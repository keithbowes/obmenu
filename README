==========
OBMENU 1.0
==========

Obmenu is a menu editor for Openbox and Waybox, written in Python. It allows
you to edit menus in an intuitive way.

PORT:

This is a port of the original obmenu to update it for Python 3/GTK 3 and to
allow it to work with Waybox.  What's left to do:

- Port the pipemenus to Python 3 as well

Future plans:

- Actually allow translating the translatable strings?

REQUIREMENTS:

  python >= 3.5, girepository

INSTALLATION:
	
  Type these commands in a shell:
  
  sudo python setup.py install

  or
  python minisetup.py install
  if you don't want the pipemenus
	
CHANGELOG:

- Automatically reconfigures Openbox

- Create and modify pipemenus. Pipemenus are a way of creating menus
  dynamically. For more info, visit openbox documentation.

- The same with "link" menus, which are references to other menus by their IDs.
  That way you can reproduce a menu in several places of your file.

- Lot's of GUI enhancements

- Multifile support (New, open, save, ..)
