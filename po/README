Translations for obMenu.

To add a translation, create an obmenu.po file in a subdirectory named the
shortest form of the ISO code for your language and add the same code to
LINGUAS.

I've done the German, Esperanto, and Spanish translations.  My Spanish isn't
that good, but I figure it's a good tribute to the original author of obMenu,
whose native language was Spanish.
